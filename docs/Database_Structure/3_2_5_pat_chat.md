#### 3.2.5 `PatChat`

Clinic Edge offers the functionality to take the medical history of a patient via chatting with an AI bot (text or audio). The information, which is gathered during the anamnesis, is stored in the table `PatChat` and assigned to the patient case using the `pat_id`. In addition to the `content` of the conversation, the table also contains some audio information if this functionality is used.
