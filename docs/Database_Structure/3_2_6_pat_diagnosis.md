# 3.2.6 `PatDiagnosis` 

`PatDiagnosis` contains the diagnoses, which were assigned to the patients by users. The table cointains the `id`, which is unique for every given diagnosis, the `pat_id`, so it is linked to the right patient (-> `PatBase`), and the `diagnosis_id`, which refers to the ICD-10 diagnosis codes.
