Happy New Year! We're kicking off 2026 with exciting news: **Clinic Edge V2** is coming, and we've secured funding from Heinrich Heine University to make it happen! 🎉

## New Partnership, New Possibilities

We're thrilled to announce that Heinrich Heine University has committed funding to accelerate Clinic Edge development. This partnership validates our mission and opens doors to transformative new features that will reshape how medical students learn clinical reasoning.

## What's Coming in V2

### 🤖 Enhanced AI Patient Chat

Our LLM-based patient conversations are getting a major upgrade! We're introducing **custom-built scenarios** that take you beyond traditional anamnesis into comprehensive clinical encounters, plus **improved voice interactions** for a more natural, hands-free experience that mirrors real patient consultations.

But here's what we're most excited about: **Edit Mode**. This game-changing feature lets both students and educators easily modify patient cases on the fly. Want to see how a different prompt changes the conversation? Curious about building your own case data? Edit Mode makes it simple to experiment, learn the mechanics of case creation, and understand how subtle changes in prompts dramatically alter patient interactions and clinical scenarios.

### 🔬 Expanded Diagnostic Options

We're dramatically expanding the range of available diagnostic tests and procedures. From advanced imaging modalities to specialized lab panels, V2 will offer a comprehensive diagnostic toolkit that mirrors real-world clinical practice.

### 📊 Custom Report Generation for Ultrasound

Create detailed, professional ultrasound reports directly within the platform! Students will practice documenting findings, interpreting images, and generating clinical reports—essential skills often overlooked in traditional education.

### 🏥 Beyond Ob&Gyn

While we started in obstetrics and gynecology, 2026 marks our expansion across multiple specialties at HHU. We're partnering with departments throughout the university to bring Clinic Edge to internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and more. Each specialty will feature tailored cases, specialty-specific workflows, and authentic clinical scenarios.

## Why This Matters

These aren't just features—they're fundamental improvements to how medical education works. By combining cutting-edge AI with proven pedagogical approaches, we're creating learning experiences that were impossible just a few years ago.

## Stay Tuned

We'll be rolling out updates throughout the year, and we can't wait to share the journey with you. Keep an eye on this blog for feature announcements, beta testing opportunities, and behind-the-scenes development insights.

Here's to making 2026 the year clinical education takes a giant leap forward! 🚀
