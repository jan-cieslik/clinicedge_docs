Today marks a significant milestone for Clinic Edge: we're officially open-sourcing our codebase under the MIT License and submitting our work for peer review! 🎓

## Opening Our Doors to the Community

We believe great educational tools are built through collaboration, transparency, and shared knowledge. That's why we've made our entire codebase publicly available on GitHub under the permissive MIT License.

**Check it out:** [github.com/jan-cieslik/clinic_edge](https://github.com/jan-cieslik/clinic_edge)

### Why MIT?

The MIT License gives you the freedom to use, modify, and distribute Clinic Edge for any purpose—commercial or otherwise. Whether you're an educator wanting to customize the platform for your institution, a developer interested in contributing features, or a researcher building upon our work, you're welcome to do so with minimal restrictions.

## From Code to Academia

Building Clinic Edge has been an incredible journey, and we're excited to share our insights, methodology, and results with the broader academic community. We've submitted our work as a manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal, documenting:

- **Pedagogical approach**: How we designed clinical cases to maximize learning outcomes
- **Technical architecture**: Our decisions around system design, database structure, and user experience
- **Evaluation results**: Real-world feedback and performance metrics from educators and students
- **Best practices**: Lessons learned from developing an interactive clinical education platform

## What This Means for You

**For Educators**: Feel confident that our platform is built on solid academic foundations and peer-reviewed methodology.

**For Developers**: Fork the repo, submit pull requests, and help us build something even better. Your contributions matter.

**For Researchers**: Build upon our work, cite our findings, and push the boundaries of clinical education technology.

**For Institutions**: Deploy and customize your own instance with full access to the source code.

## Join the Movement

Open source thrives on community participation. Whether you're fixing bugs, proposing features, improving documentation, or sharing your experiences, every contribution helps advance clinical education for everyone.

We're just getting started, and we can't wait to see what we'll build together! 🚀
